B2M3u
=====

Convert's [[http://www.banshee-project.org|Banshee]] playlists to m3u playlists
and extracts mentioned music files to a flat directory.

This allows copying playlists as whole directories with music already included,
to be used with dumb media players, e.g. the Palm Pre smartphone.

Requirements
------------

Before you can use B2M3u, some additional libraries are required:

- sqlalchemy (python-sqlalchemy in debian/ubuntu)
- mutagen (python-mutagen in debian/ubuntu)

Usage
-----

    ./b2m3u.py [-v] [-r]

Options:

- **-v** print every song name while processing
- **-r** replace "album" tag with "Playlists"

When run, b2m3u lists all human-made playlists within Banshee and allows the
user to choose. The playlist selected and its song files will be copied to a new
directory named after the playlist. 

B2M3u offers to replace album ID3 tags within song filenames with "Playlists".
That way, your "sort by album" view won't be full of albums that only have one
song or, worse, albums that carry some songs double.

After processing, it should be simple to just copy/move the newly created
directory to your media player.
